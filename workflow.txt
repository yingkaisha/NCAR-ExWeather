1. Download grib files
2. Subtrack variables from grib files and compress them as .zarr
3. Compute mean and std on each location and forcast lead times
4. Perform data normalization, and generate training / validation batches
5. Train CNNs to produce feature vectors
6. Fine tnue CNN with alternate training
7. Check the integrety of forecast lead times; for each location and initialization time, if all of its forecat lead times have good quality, it will be preserved.
8. Predict feature vectors on training / validation batches
9. Train classification heads based on feature vectors
10. Testing set prediction and inference
